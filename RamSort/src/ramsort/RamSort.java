//  12 points: In the main method, invoke all the methods you've implemented (described below) at least five times 
//  each on different inputs, for testing purposes.  Write all the inputs and the results into the console.
//  This is the "testing" portion of your code.
    }
    
//  24 points: Define a method named countingSort. Implement Counting Sort as in the slides/textbook. One parameter will
// be the input array to sort. Another parameter will be a memory allocated array of the same length, for storing the 
// output. The third parameter will be the largest single input value. You may write your code one-indexed or
// zero-indexed, but be aware the pseudocode one-indexes the input and output while zero-indexing the auxiliary array C.
    
    
    
    
    
//  24 points: Define a method named randomizedQuickselect. Implement Randomized Quickselect as in the slides/textbook. 
//  One parameter is the input array.  Two more parameters are the inclusive bounds of the subarray to consider. 
//  One more parameter is i, the order statistic number to find the value of in the input array. This method must
//  be nondestructive, meaning it does not reorder or modify the original input array! So, you will want to make a local 
//  copy of the input array using java.util.Arrays.copyOf, then use the local copy for everything. You will also need 
//  to reuse the same partition method from homework 4, which you used for quicksort.  If your partition method is not 
//  working properly, I strongly recommend you debug it and get it working correctly before moving on to the rest of 
//  this assignment.
    
    
//    
//    10 points extra credit: Define a method named radixSort, implementing a base-10 Radix Sort as in the 
//    slides/textbook. This will only be a few lines of code to define the radixSort method, but you 
//    will also need to create some private helper methods:


//    A private helper method named getDigit to obtain and return the value of a single given base-10 digit's value from
//    a given int value. For example, getDigit(1, 493) would return the value of the "1's place" in 493, which is 
//    the number 3. You can make that helper method a purely math function, or instead make it with String methods.

    
    
    
//    A private helper method named countingSortOnDigit, which is a modified version of countingSort with an additional
//    parameter indicating which base-10 digit is to be used for comparisons. (1 for rightmost digit, 2 for second 
//    digit from the right, etc.) Make sure your countingSort works properly before you make this new version.  
//    The only difference will be the line(s) of code that directly compare two elements, which will invoke digitOf 
//    and use that single digit value, instead of comparing one entire input value with another.
